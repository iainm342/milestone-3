## **MANUAL TESTING** ##

- Chrome Developer Tools were used to test responsiveness on all screen sizes.
- Physical testing was carried out on Desktop, Tablet and various Mobile devices.
    - Throughout the whole process I was testing the responsiveness of the site on my laptop, iPhone X and iPad.
    - Once the site was in a state that I was happy with, I submitted it for Peer review.
    - I also asked friends and family to have a look at the site from a user perspective, rather than a coder perspective.
- All links were tested to ensure they worked on all devices.
- NavBar was tested to ensure it worked on all devices.
- All Modals tested to ensure correct information was displayed and that the links directed the user to the appropriate external site.
- Both registration pages were tested to ensure that the **user** form cleared after hitting the "Submit" button and that the **user** received an email confirming the process.
