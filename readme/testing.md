## **MANUAL TESTING** ##

- Chrome Developer Tools were used to test responsiveness on all screen sizes.
- Physical testing was carried out on Desktop, Tablet and various Mobile devices.
    - Throughout the whole process, I was testing the responsiveness of the site with my laptop, iPhone X and iPad.
    - Once the site was in a state that I was happy with, I submitted it for Peer review.
    - I also asked friends and family to have a look at the site from a user perspective, rather than a coders perspective.
- All links were tested to ensure they worked on all devices.
- NavBar was tested to ensure it worked on all devices.
- All CRUD functions were tested to ensure they worked on all devices.

## **AUTOMATED TESTING** ##

### <ins>CODE VALIDATION</ins> ###

All HTML and CSS was passed through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C Validator CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), JavaScript and jQuery through [JShint](https://jshint.com/) and Python through [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/).

HTML Errors:

- Persistent warning on all pages due to the section on every page for flash messages

![HTML Error](https://github.com/iainm342/milestone-3/blob/master/readme/images/section-warning.png)

- alt missing from most images. Resolved and passed.
- recipes.html had an extra " on line 45 which caused multiple errors. Resolved and passed.

CSS Errors:

- CSS passed with no errors.

![CSS Validation](https://github.com/iainm342/milestone-3/blob/master/readme/images/CSS-validated.png)

JShint Errors:

- all JS and jQuery has been passed through the Validator, however, various warnings were presented with regards to the $ in jQuery. Searching has shown that some extra code should be added to the .jshintrc to remove these warnings - this is outwith my current knowledge and skill base and will need some further research on my part.
